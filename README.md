# Weather_App

## Description

I created a weather web application. I really wanted to test my skill using and implementing APIs. This application loads with nasvilles current and next 5 days of the forecast.
You can also search or click from some listed options on any other city. This application uses multiple OpenWeather APIs. This application also has dynamic scaling to fit to any screen size.
